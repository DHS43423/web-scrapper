# web-scrapper

A simple web scrapper script written in python along with GUI, that downloads movie and songs from web.

Just make sure to download appropriate chrome driver, as per your chrome version inorder to run the script.(I have made use of v73)
<p>Link for chrome drivers: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads</p>

<b>Run as executable:</b>
   Executable file is stored in dist folder. From whereever you want to run the webscrapper.exe , make sure the chromedriver        file remains in the same folder 

Note: I am not responsible for any illegal data upload on web and for any illegal use,this is just a small project from my side.
