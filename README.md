# web-scrapper

A simple web scrapper script written in python along with GUI, that downloads movie and songs from web.

Just make sure to download appropriate chrome driver, as per your chrome version inorder to run the script.(I have made use of v73)
<p>Link for chrome drivers: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads</p>

<p>Keep the chrome driver file in the same folder as the code.</p>

Remember- Line:71 in code -> Chnage the path for your download for movies.
